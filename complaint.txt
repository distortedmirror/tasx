I just took an online proctored test (see: https://tinyurl.com/IntelliswiftDiscriminationBias) that I believe is discriminatory as a tactic to try to keep rates down and get me to accept lower pay by degrading me with stupid mistakes in tests and validations that mock you and score unfairly. Someone will get the job instead of me because of this error. At https://tinyurl.com/IntelliswiftDiscriminationBias   for the test you go to a amusement park with 4 tokens with 3 rides, one costs 5 tokens, another costs 2 tokens and third one costs 1 token and they want to know what the maximum number of rides you can take and they say 2. Obviously you can take the 1 token test 4 times.  I am to write the code to calculate this and there is an automated test that verifies my code.  There is an automated test that either passes or fails my code. Note that I am on Social Security Disability with a Mental Disability and should be protected by the ADA, and I'm guessing that's what this is all about, but otherwise I'm unsure what is motivating this, perhaps race, as I'm Hispanic, which is extremely rare in my field.
